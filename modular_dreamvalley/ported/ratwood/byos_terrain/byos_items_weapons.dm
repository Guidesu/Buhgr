// "Ancient" (Zizo-era gilbranze) weapon and armor variants used by byos.dmm.
// Ported from Ratwood-2.0's rogueweapon melee/shield files. All parent types
// already exist in this codebase; these leaves only override icon_state /
// smeltresult / flavor text, and all icon_states already exist in this
// repo's shared weapon icon sheets, so no new icon assets were required.
// Zizo/Vheslyn lore references are unrenamed base-game entities (the ancient
// false-god / first-murder myth), not part of the pantheon rename, so their
// flavor text is kept verbatim.
