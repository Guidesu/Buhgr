	Tieflings arrive in the lands of Grimoria in two ways — either fleeing the Inferno, or being born on mortal lands as one of the unfortunate consequences of demonic invasions. The attitude of other races toward these two categories of half-bloods varies greatly. Those who came into being due to demon attacks are considered a curse upon their entire lineage for obvious reasons; they are persecuted and despised. On the other hand, those who left the Inferno of their own will often enjoy far greater respect, especially if it was the result of an armed uprising. Tieflings who went against their demonic nature and proved it in deed became the founders of several noble lines in Zybantia, Grenzelhoft, and Azuria."

	After the fall of the Divine Empire, a significant portion of elves journeyed north, away from the ravaged imperial lands. These refugees — the future northern elves — founded Hammerhold and settled the lands of the Narrow Sea (now a vassal of Grenzelhoft), and some even reached Gronn. The northern elves adapted to the harsh climate and rugged way of life of their new homeland. They adopted many customs of the human society of Hammerhold without losing their race's characteristic longevity and aristocratic refinement.

Having lost the greater part of their forces, the drow were forced to flee to the Underdark, where a new chapter of their history began. \
	Finding themselves in such an inhospitable environment, the former elves had to change, not without the help of the arcane might of the Spider Queens. Their skin darkened significantly, their hair turned white, and their eyes, having adapted to the darkness, turned red. The Queens endowed the women with far greater physical strength than the men, which is why matriarchy reigns supreme everywhere in their cities. The high priestesses of the Spider Queens occasionally received their blessing in the form of a metamorphosis that endows them with spider-like traits, but encountering such a one on the surface in these times is a rarity."

It is believed that those of the races of Grimoria who are unfortunate enough to perish in the lands of Mandira — or become trapped in them long enough for the corruptive influence of these lands, forever tainted by the power of unlife since the Forbidden's invasion, to become irreversible — become dullahans. \
	Revenants began appearing in the lands of Grimoria relatively recently — the first encounter with them was recorded in the chronicles of Otava seventy years ago. Like the tieflings before them, revenants cross the boundary between Planes, fleeing the Inferno for various reasons. Their unnatural nature, however, has become a cause for distrust and apprehension among the inhabitants of Grimoria — where tieflings are accepted, and sometimes even exalted for their willingness to fight their demonic nature, dullahans are feared and rejected throughout the world.

Possessing a portion of their creator's divine power, these messengers were met by mortals with awe and respect, and their words were often interpreted as the ultimate truth. As aasimars proved their usefulness, all the deities of the Pantheon, as well as the Allfather himself, adopted this practice, creating their own messengers among the mortal races of Grimoria. \
	It is said that the power of an aasimar can slumber in a family's genetic line for many generations, until its time comes. At least, this is how the birth of aasimars to ordinary mortal couples is explained in our days. Despite the fact that the former reverence for divine messengers is no longer as widespread, the birth of an aasimar is still considered a blessed omen for the family, and the aasimar themselves, as well as their parents, often find themselves surrounded by honor and respect. \
